# Completed Tasks:

find - finds student based on studID
range - display info for students from StudID(A) to StudID(B)
gpa - shows gpa of student or average gpa for students from A->B
del - deletes info for specific course of student

## Other Information

I implemented the childArray to hold tree node's so the children dont have to be link lists although I append llNode's to the childArray as well. 

The implementation of load created a more modular design of running the different calls.

The implementation of the tree is based on a textbook for data structures (Java) as stated in the fulltree.h file.
